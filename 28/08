System Programming and Scripting:
introduction of system:
  what is process, program ,diff betn them, what is algorithm, softwares, system softwares, application softwares
  what are the languages, their types, low and high. machine.
  how computer works, how languages are developed
  why languages are required, how to develop a software.

what is computational thinking?
  it's a probem solving approach that involves breaking down complex problems into smaller more maneageable parts in order to 
  devise effective solutions that can be executed by a computer or human.

  converting thought exercise into the solution 

  decomposition
  breaking down a problem into smaller more maneageable components or steps, this makes the problem easier to understand or solve
  putting the solutions of sub solutions together gives a solution to the original, complex problem
  
  pattern recognition
    identifying common patterns or similarities within different parts of a solution
    helps in recognizing rexurring themes and simplifies the development of general solutions
    makes problems easier to solve since the same solution can be used for each occurence of the pattern
  
  abstraction
    we determine what characteristics of the problem are important and filter out from those who are not
    use these to create a representation of what we are trying to solve
    it allows you to work with simplified models of a problem, which can lead to more efficient and elegant solutions
    *eg: data required for student registration*

  algorithm (designing)
    approaching problems in a step by step systematic manner that allows for the efficient execution of algorithms
    identifies what is to be done (the instructions) and the order in which they should be done
    can be described in english, as a flowchart or by writing pseudocode



  PROBLEM : FIND MAX
  find the maximum value among a list of values

  draw a flowchart for finding the smallest two values in the collection
